# C++ Chat with users via Client-Server architecture (based on winAPI)
Chat c++ winAPI

This program implements a client-server architecture, where clients can connect to the server using its IP address and communicate with each other. To connect to the server, users must input their name and the server's IP address.

To run the server, it's important to make sure that ports are not blocked, both in the router settings (which can be accessed by entering the PC's local IP address and finding the Port Forwarding or Virtual Server parameter) and in the Windows Firewall settings. Additionally, clients should be allowed to listen to the corresponding port by adding a rule to their Firewall.

While this program is still a work in progress and has its flaws, it is an attempt to create a functional client-server architecture. Future updates will address these flaws and improve the program's functionality.

Overall, my program is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning about client-server communication, and I hope it will be useful to others who are just starting out in this field!
